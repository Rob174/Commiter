# Commiter

## GOAL

Use only commits (with issues if details required) to indicate the status of a small project
Tool designed for my own use (where i am working alone), but can be used for other projects too.


## Why (Personnal subjective view)

### Github project disadvantages:

The automation can not be based on commits and use more issues as bases for the automation.

I find it difficult to see the tasks done when the amount starts to accumulate.
